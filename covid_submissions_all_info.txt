We converted it to a peptidomimetic molecule with a Michael acceptor for covalent bonding to Cys145 and docked it onto 6y2e PDB using rosetta ligand docking. The approximate ligand docking protocol is as follows, 
1. First we used SiteHound to identify posssible ligand binding sites in 6y2e using a Methyl probe. Three binding sites were found but only the active site showed the highest score qualifying for the subsequent docking run. 
2. The ligand was placed close to 6y2e at the XYZ coordinates obtained for high scoring solution from SiteHound. 10,000 docking poses were generated by restricting the ligand to a box of 10 Å radius and perturbing (rotation + translation) the ligand 5 Å. Rosetta calculated the interface_delta score which is approximate measure of the interaction between the ligand and the protein. Top 10 solution sorted using interface_delta score were manually inspected in pymol. All 10 solutions docked the ligand in the active site.
Key Features of the docked pose are:
- The peptidomimetic molecule contains two phenylalanines and one arginine. 
- The Michael acceptor is placed close to C145 for covalent bond formation
- The N-term Phe occupies hydrophobic pocket formed by residues H41, M49, F140, H163
- The C-term Phe occupies hydrophobic pocket formed by residues M165, L167, F185 and V186
- Arg forms a salt-bridge to E166 and another polar contact to the backbone carbonyls of residues L167 and P168.

This made me immediately think of benzenesulfonamide drugs as there are a few of those. Among them, Hydrochlorothiazide seems to both nicely fulfil the benzensulfonamide pharmacophore as the N of the secondary sulfonamide also so-localizes with the tertiary amine of a few other fragments (e.g. x0354).

So, on the one side, you could potentially cocrystalize Hydrochlorothiazide alone and explore it for repurposing. On the other hand, as the compound is commercial, you could use it as a scaffold. I have used it as a scaffold in the molecule I sketched and explored whether I could add a pyridine with a linker to reach the pyridine hotspot. I think the linker I used would be the ideal length but you could explore several other linkers as well. I believe it should be possible to derivatize the sulfonamide but it's true that this could be challenging given there is another sulfonamide in the structure that could cross-react. I hope this helps, thank you so much for this initiative!","x0161,x0195,x0426,x0434,x0678,x0946,x0995",False,False,False,https://covid.postera.ai/covid/submissions/e2bfce8e-6c72-4d09-8d33-3db2858d1429,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False

The combination lopinavir/ritonavir is currently tested against COVID-19, but ""no benefit was observed with lopinavir–ritonavir treatment beyond standard care"". (doi: 10.1056/NEJMoa2001282)

Reportedly, lopinavir has only mid-micromolar activity against SARS protease, ritonavir above 50 microM. (doi: 10.12688/f1000research.22457.1; doi: 10.1073/pnas.0403596101)

However, there is no crystal structure of the 2019-nCoV main protease with either of these two drugs that could clarify their potential for optimization against this target. Thus, I suggest lopinavir, ritonavir, and reasonably similar substructures available from catalog for soaking.

Procedure in KNIME:

1) search all substructures of lopinavir and ritonavir in MolPort
2) remove all redundant compounds and compounds with similarity < 0.5 (datawarrior SkelPheres) to either of the queries
3) remove all compounds void of a ring or containing amides (as substructures of amides)

Design protocol: Fragments co-crystalized with COVID-19 main protease (released by the Diamond Xchem group) served as starting 
scaffolds for combinatorial chemistry with an in-development Meiler Lab algorithm called BCL::LinkFragments. After filtering ~800,000 fragment combinations for physchem properties, geometry (i.e. pocket complementarity), and predicted activity, we performed focused library design (BCL::FocusedLibraryDesign) on a subset of the best new molecules. The variation of this algorithm 
 utilized for this study incorporated a conventional supervised feed-forward deep neural network (DNN) as a pose-dependent protein-ligand  interface scorer. Fragments were perturbed in a Monte Carlo - Metropolis fashion using alchemical transformations, and refined at each step to minimize clashes, optimize pose orientation, and filter out unstable/non-drug-like modifications.

 Notes on the chemical profile:

Design protocol: Fragments co-crystalized with COVID-19 main protease (released by the Diamond Xchem group) served as starting 
scaffolds for combinatorial chemistry with an in-development Meiler Lab algorithm called BCL::LinkFragments. After filtering ~800,000 fragment combinations for physchem properties, geometry (i.e. pocket complementarity), and predicted activity, we performed focused library design (BCL::FocusedLibraryDesign) on a subset of the best new molecules. The variation of this algorithm 
 utilized for this study incorporated a conventional supervised feed-forward deep neural network (DNN) as a pose-dependent protein-ligand  interface scorer. Fragments were perturbed in a Monte Carlo - Metropolis fashion using alchemical transformations, and refined at each step to minimize clashes, optimize pose orientation, and filter out unstable/non-drug-like modifications. Molecules are optimized for clash resolution and interaction score. The best molecules undergo a final short run of BCL::FocusedLibraryDesign, and minor manual modifications are selectively made to intentionally increase probing of the structure-activity relationship (SAR). Finally, compounds are re-docked with RosettaLigand. The top-scoring complex is taken to be the final pose. Note that in multiple instances there is more than 1 well-populated binding pose. Here, we simply took the best scoring pose. Also note that the pose optimizing the RosettaLigand score is not the same pose that optimizes the DNN score. 

Nomenclature: XLogP, XLogS, and XdG_Hyd are LogP, LogS, and dg_hydration (kcal/mol) predictions made using a multi-tasking deep neural network trained in the BCL. LipinksiDruglike returns 1 if there are less than 2 Lipinksi violations. RS_Score_Raw and RSCONVOL_Score_Raw are two novel (in preparation) scoring functions developed in the BCL that use a DNN to prediction the binding affinity of small molecules to receptors (in units of -log(Kd)) using either pose-dependent or pose-dependent+pose-independent protein-ligand hybrid descriptors. RS_AD and RSCONVOL_AD are applicability domain (AD) metrics of the DNN scores; values less_equal 0.90 are generally considered good and mean we trust the corresponding activity prediction reasonably well. RosettaLigandInterfaceScore is the interface_delta_X (protein-ligand interaction score) from Rosetta v3.11 of the best pose in Talaris2014 Rosetta energy units (REU).

Design protocol: Fragments co-crystalized with COVID-19 main protease (released by the Diamond Xchem group) served as starting 
scaffolds for combinatorial chemistry with an in-development Meiler Lab algorithm called BCL::LinkFragments. After filtering ~800,000 fragment combinations for physchem properties, geometry (i.e. pocket complementarity), and predicted activity, we performed focused library design (BCL::FocusedLibraryDesign) on a subset of the best new molecules. The variation of this algorithm 
 utilized for this study incorporated a conventional supervised feed-forward deep neural network (DNN) as a pose-dependent protein-ligand  interface scorer. Fragments were perturbed in a Monte Carlo - Metropolis fashion using alchemical transformations, and refined at each step to minimize clashes, optimize pose orientation, and filter out unstable/non-drug-like modifications. Molecules are optimized for clash resolution and interaction score. The best molecules undergo a final short run of BCL::FocusedLibraryDesign, and minor manual modifications are selectively made to intentionally increase probing of the structure-activity relationship (SAR). Finally, compounds are re-docked with RosettaLigand. The top-scoring complex is taken to be the final pose. Note that in multiple instances there is more than 1 well-populated binding pose. Here, we simply took the best scoring pose. Also note that the pose optimizing the RosettaLigand score is not the same pose that optimizes the DNN score. 

Nomenclature: XLogP, XLogS, and XdG_Hyd are LogP, LogS, and dg_hydration (kcal/mol) predictions made using a multi-tasking deep neural network trained in the BCL. LipinksiDruglike returns 1 if there are less than 2 Lipinksi violations. RS_Score_Raw and RSCONVOL_Score_Raw are two novel (in preparation) scoring functions developed in the BCL that use a DNN to prediction the binding affinity of small molecules to receptors (in units of -log(Kd)) using either pose-dependent or pose-dependent+pose-independent protein-ligand hybrid descriptors.

Design protocol: Fragments co-crystalized with COVID-19 main protease (released by the Diamond Xchem group) served as starting 
scaffolds for combinatorial chemistry with an in-development Meiler Lab algorithm called BCL::LinkFragments. After filtering ~800,000 fragment combinations for physchem properties, geometry (i.e. pocket complementarity), and predicted activity, we performed focused library design (BCL::FocusedLibraryDesign) on a subset of the best new molecules. The variation of this algorithm 
 utilized for this study incorporated a conventional supervised feed-forward deep neural network (DNN) as a pose-dependent protein-ligand  interface scorer. Fragments were perturbed in a Monte Carlo - Metropolis fashion using alchemical transformations, and refined at each step to minimize clashes, optimize pose orientation, and filter out unstable/non-drug-like modifications. Molecules are optimized for clash resolution and interaction score. The best molecules undergo a final short run of BCL::FocusedLibraryDesign, and minor manual modifications are selectively made to intentionally increase probing of the structure-activity relationship (SAR). Finally, compounds are re-docked with RosettaLigand. The top-scoring complex is taken to be the final pose. Note that in multiple instances there is more than 1 well-populated binding pose. Here, we simply took the best scoring pose. Also note that the pose optimizing the RosettaLigand score is not the same pose that optimizes the DNN score.

Design protocol: Fragments co-crystalized with COVID-19 main protease (released by the Diamond Xchem group) served as starting 
scaffolds for combinatorial chemistry with an in-development Meiler Lab algorithm called BCL::LinkFragments.

The variation of this algorithm 
 utilized for this study incorporated a conventional supervised feed-forward deep neural network (DNN) as a pose-dependent protein-ligand  interface scorer.

scaffolds for combinatorial chemistry with an in-development Meiler Lab algorithm called BCL::LinkFragments. After filtering ~800,000 fragment combinations for physchem properties, geometry (i.e. pocket complementarity), and predicted activity, we performed focused library design (BCL::FocusedLibraryDesign) on a subset of the best new molecules. The variation of this algorithm 
 utilized for this study incorporated a conventional supervised feed-forward deep neural network (DNN) as a pose-dependent protein-ligand  interface scorer. Fragments were perturbed in a Monte Carlo - Metropolis fashion using alchemical transformations, and refined at each step to minimize clashes, optimize pose orientation, and filter out unstable/non-drug-like modifications. Molecules are optimized for clash resolution and interaction score. The best molecules undergo a final short run of BCL::FocusedLibraryDesign, and minor manual modifications are selectively made to intentionally increase probing of the structure-activity relationship (SAR). Finally, compounds are re-docked with RosettaLigand. The top-scoring complex is taken to be the final pose. Note that in multiple instances there is more than 1 well-populated binding pose. Here, we simply took the best scoring pose. Also note that the pose optimizing the RosettaLigand score is not the same pose that optimizes the DNN score. 

Nomenclature: XLogP, XLogS, and XdG_Hyd are LogP, LogS, and dg_hydration (kcal/mol) predictions made using a multi-tasking deep neural network trained in the BCL. LipinksiDruglike returns 1 if there are less than 2 Lipinksi violations. RS_Score_Raw and RSCONVOL_Score_Raw are two novel (in preparation) scoring functions developed in the BCL that use a DNN to prediction the binding affinity of small molecules to receptors (in units of -log(Kd)) using either pose-dependent or pose-dependent+pose-independent protein-ligand hybrid descriptors. RS_AD and RSCONVOL_AD are applicability domain (AD) metrics of the DNN scores; values less_equal 0.90 are generally considered good and mean we trust the corresponding activity prediction reasonably well. RosettaLigandInterfaceScore is the interface_delta_X (protein-ligand interaction score) from Rosetta v3.11 of the best pose in Talaris2014 Rosetta energy units (REU).

scaffolds for combinatorial chemistry with an in-development Meiler Lab algorithm called BCL::LinkFragments. After filtering ~800,000 fragment combinations for physchem properties, geometry (i.e. pocket complementarity), and predicted activity, we performed focused library design (BCL::FocusedLibraryDesign) on a subset of the best new molecules. The variation of this algorithm 
 utilized for this study incorporated a conventional supervised feed-forward deep neural network (DNN) as a pose-dependent protein-ligand  interface scorer. Fragments were perturbed in a Monte Carlo - Metropolis fashion using alchemical transformations, and refined at each step to minimize clashes, optimize pose orientation, and filter out unstable/non-drug-like modifications. Molecules are optimized for clash resolution and interaction score. The best molecules undergo a final short run of BCL::FocusedLibraryDesign, and minor manual modifications are selectively made to intentionally increase probing of the structure-activity relationship (SAR). Finally, compounds are re-docked with RosettaLigand. The top-scoring complex is taken to be the final pose. Note that in multiple instances there is more than 1 well-populated binding pose. Here, we simply took the best scoring pose. Also note that the pose optimizing the RosettaLigand score is not the same pose that optimizes the DNN score. 

Nomenclature: XLogP, XLogS, and XdG_Hyd are LogP, LogS, and dg_hydration (kcal/mol) predictions made using a multi-tasking deep neural network trained in the BCL. LipinksiDruglike returns 1 if there are less than 2 Lipinksi violations. RS_Score_Raw and RSCONVOL_Score_Raw are two novel (in preparation) scoring functions developed in the BCL that use a DNN to prediction the binding affinity of small molecules to receptors (in units of -log(Kd)) using either pose-dependent or pose-dependent+pose-independent protein-ligand hybrid descriptors. RS_AD and RSCONVOL_AD are applicability domain (AD) metrics of the DNN scores; values less_equal 0.90 are generally considered good and mean we trust the corresponding activity prediction reasonably well. RosettaLigandInterfaceScore is the interface_delta_X (protein-ligand interaction score) from Rosetta v3.11 of the best pose in Talaris2014 Rosetta energy units (REU). MoleculeComplexity is a metric by Ertl. et al., 2009, Journal of Cheminformatics, and generally less than 2.5 indicates the molecule is reasonably synthesizable.","x0692,x0770,x0995",False,False,False,https://covid.postera.ai/covid/submissions/c986b20b-1002-4cae-badd-32cce9d7c04b,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False

Design protocol: Fragments co-crystalized with COVID-19 main protease (released by the Diamond Xchem group) served as starting 
scaffolds for combinatorial chemistry with an in-development Meiler Lab algorithm called BCL::LinkFragments. After filtering ~800,000 fragment combinations for physchem properties, geometry (i.e. pocket complementarity), and predicted activity, we performed focused library design (BCL::FocusedLibraryDesign) on a subset of the best new molecules. The variation of this algorithm 
 utilized for this study incorporated a conventional supervised feed-forward deep neural network (DNN) as a pose-dependent protein-ligand  interface scorer. Fragments were perturbed in a Monte Carlo - Metropolis fashion using alchemical transformations, and refined at each step to minimize clashes, optimize pose orientation, and filter out unstable/non-drug-like modifications. Molecules are optimized for clash resolution and interaction score. The best molecules undergo a final short run of BCL::FocusedLibraryDesign, and minor manual modifications are selectively made to intentionally increase probing of the structure-activity relationship (SAR). Finally, compounds are re-docked with RosettaLigand. The top-scoring complex is taken to be the final pose. Note that in multiple instances there is more than 1 well-populated binding pose. Here, we simply took the best scoring pose. Also note that the pose optimizing the RosettaLigand score is not the same pose that optimizes the DNN score. 

Nomenclature: XLogP, XLogS, and XdG_Hyd are LogP, LogS, and dg_hydration (kcal/mol) predictions made using a multi-tasking deep neural network trained in the BCL. LipinksiDruglike returns 1 if there are less than 2 Lipinksi violations. RS_Score_Raw and RSCONVOL_Score_Raw are two novel (in preparation) scoring functions developed in the BCL that use a DNN to prediction the binding affinity of small molecules to receptors (in units of -log(Kd)) using either pose-dependent or pose-dependent+pose-independent protein-ligand hybrid descriptors. RS_AD and RSCONVOL_AD are applicability domain (AD) metrics of the DNN scores; values less_equal 0.90 are generally considered good and mean we trust the corresponding activity prediction reasonably well. RosettaLigandInterfaceScore is the interface_delta_X (protein-ligand interaction score) from Rosetta v3.11 of the best pose in Talaris2014 Rosetta energy units (REU).

Design protocol: Fragments co-crystalized with COVID-19 main protease (released by the Diamond Xchem group) served as starting 
scaffolds for combinatorial chemistry with an in-development Meiler Lab algorithm called BCL::LinkFragments. After filtering ~800,000 fragment combinations for physchem properties, geometry (i.e. pocket complementarity), and predicted activity, we performed focused library design (BCL::FocusedLibraryDesign) on a subset of the best new molecules. The variation of this algorithm 
 utilized for this study incorporated a conventional supervised feed-forward deep neural network (DNN) as a pose-dependent protein-ligand  interface scorer. Fragments were perturbed in a Monte Carlo - Metropolis fashion using alchemical transformations, and refined at each step to minimize clashes, optimize pose orientation, and filter out unstable/non-drug-like modifications. Molecules are optimized for clash resolution and interaction score. The best molecules undergo a final short run of BCL::FocusedLibraryDesign, and minor manual modifications are selectively made to intentionally increase probing of the structure-activity relationship (SAR). Finally, compounds are re-docked with RosettaLigand. The top-scoring complex is taken to be the final pose. Note that in multiple instances there is more than 1 well-populated binding pose. Here, we simply took the best scoring pose. Also note that the pose optimizing the RosettaLigand score is not the same pose that optimizes the DNN score.

Design protocol: Fragments co-crystalized with COVID-19 main protease (released by the Diamond Xchem group) served as starting 
scaffolds for combinatorial chemistry with an in-development Meiler Lab algorithm called BCL::LinkFragments. After filtering ~800,000 fragment combinations for physchem properties, geometry (i.e. pocket complementarity), and predicted activity, we performed focused library design (BCL::FocusedLibraryDesign) on a subset of the best new molecules. The variation of this algorithm 
 utilized for this study incorporated a conventional supervised feed-forward deep neural network (DNN) as a pose-dependent protein-ligand  interface scorer. Fragments were perturbed in a Monte Carlo - Metropolis fashion using alchemical transformations, and refined at each step to minimize clashes, optimize pose orientation, and filter out unstable/non-drug-like modifications. Molecules are optimized for clash resolution and interaction score. The best molecules undergo a final short run of BCL::FocusedLibraryDesign, and minor manual modifications are selectively made to intentionally increase probing of the structure-activity relationship (SAR).

Fragments were perturbed in a Monte Carlo - Metropolis fashion using alchemical transformations, and refined at each step to minimize clashes, optimize pose orientation, and filter out unstable/non-drug-like modifications.

The best molecules undergo a final short run of BCL::FocusedLibraryDesign, and minor manual modifications are selectively made to intentionally increase probing of the structure-activity relationship (SAR). Finally, compounds are re-docked with RosettaLigand. The top-scoring complex is taken to be the final pose. Note that in multiple instances there is more than 1 well-populated binding pose. Here, we simply took the best scoring pose. Also note that the pose optimizing the RosettaLigand score is not the same pose that optimizes the DNN score.

scaffolds for combinatorial chemistry with an in-development Meiler Lab algorithm called BCL::LinkFragments. After filtering ~800,000 fragment combinations for physchem properties, geometry (i.e. pocket complementarity), and predicted activity, we performed focused library design (BCL::FocusedLibraryDesign) on a subset of the best new molecules. The variation of this algorithm 
 utilized for this study incorporated a conventional supervised feed-forward deep neural network (DNN) as a pose-dependent protein-ligand  interface scorer. Fragments were perturbed in a Monte Carlo - Metropolis fashion using alchemical transformations, and refined at each step to minimize clashes, optimize pose orientation, and filter out unstable/non-drug-like modifications. Molecules are optimized for clash resolution and interaction score. The best molecules undergo a final short run of BCL::FocusedLibraryDesign, and minor manual modifications are selectively made to intentionally increase probing of the structure-activity relationship (SAR). Finally, compounds are re-docked with RosettaLigand. The top-scoring complex is taken to be the final pose. Note that in multiple instances there is more than 1 well-populated binding pose. Here, we simply took the best scoring pose. Also note that the pose optimizing the RosettaLigand score is not the same pose that optimizes the DNN score. 

Nomenclature: XLogP, XLogS, and XdG_Hyd are LogP, LogS, and dg_hydration (kcal/mol) predictions made using a multi-tasking deep neural network trained in the BCL. LipinksiDruglike returns 1 if there are less than 2 Lipinksi violations. RS_Score_Raw and RSCONVOL_Score_Raw are two novel (in preparation) scoring functions developed in the BCL that use a DNN to prediction the binding affinity of small molecules to receptors (in units of -log(Kd)) using either pose-dependent or pose-dependent+pose-independent protein-ligand hybrid descriptors. RS_AD and RSCONVOL_AD are applicability domain (AD) metrics of the DNN scores; values less_equal 0.90 are generally considered good and mean we trust the corresponding activity prediction reasonably well. RosettaLigandInterfaceScore is the interface_delta_X (protein-ligand interaction score) from Rosetta v3.11 of the best pose in Talaris2014 Rosetta energy units (REU). MoleculeComplexity is a metric by Ertl. et al., 2009, Journal of Cheminformatics, and generally less than 2.5 indicates the molecule is reasonably synthesizable.","x0104,x0107,x0946,x0995",False,False,False,https://covid.postera.ai/covid/submissions/d8fd1356-48a3-47db-b12f-ee2f1a630081,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False

# Design protocol: Fragments co-crystalized with COVID-19 main protease (released to the PDB by von Grelft group) served as starting
# scaffolds for redesign with an in-development Meiler Lab algorithm called BCL::FocusedLibraryDesign. The variation of this algorithm 
# utilized for this study incorporated a conventional supervised feed-forward deep neural network (DNN) as a pose-dependent protein-ligand 
# interface scorer. Fragments were perturbed in a Monte Carlo - Metropolis fashion using alchemical transformations, and refined at each step
# to minimize clashes, optimize pose orientation, and filter out unstable/non-drug-like modifications. The best optimizations by QSAR/QSPR analysis
# are recombined with BCL::LinkFragments, an in-development combinatorial chemistry algorithm. Again, molecules are optimized for clash resolution and
# interaction score. The best molecules undergo a final short run of BCL::FocusedLibraryDesign, and minor manual modifications are selectively made to
# intentionally increase probing of the structure-activity relationship (SAR). Finally, compounds are re-docked with RosettaLigand. The top-scoring complex
# is taken to be the final pose. Note that in multiple instances there is more than 1 well-populated binding pose. Here, we simply took the best scoring
# pose.
#
# Nomenclature: XLogP, XLogS, and XdG_Hyd are LogP, LogS, and dg_hydration (kcal/mol) predictions made using a multi-tasking deep neural network trained 
# in the BCL. LipinksiDruglike returns 1 if there are less than 2 Lipinksi violations. RS_Score_Raw and RSCONVOL_Score_Raw are two novel (in preparation)
# scoring functions developed in the BCL that use a DNN to prediction the binding affinity of small molecules to receptors (in units of -log(Kd)) using 
# either pose-dependent or pose-dependent+pose-independent protein-ligand hybrid descriptors. RS_AD and RSCONVOL_AD are applicability domain (AD) metrics
# of the DNN scores; values less_equal 0.90 are generally considered good and mean we trust the corresponding activity prediction reasonably well.
# RosettaLigandInterfaceScore is the interface_delta_X (protein-ligand interaction score) from Rosetta v3.11 of the best pose in Talaris2014 Rosetta energy
# units (REU). MoleculeComplexity is a metric by Ertl. et al., 2009, Journal of Cheminformatics, and generally less than 2.5 indicates the molecule is
# reasonably synthesizable.

The N-phenylbenzamide scaffold of Niclosamide may bind in similar way as the benzamide (X_0678) and (di)phenylurea (X_0434) scaffolds observed in several fragments.

Obviously early days and appreciating that recognising simple substructures between hits and assuming they bind in a similar manner can be deceiving. I have therefore also included 9 designs to efficiently explore simple SAR around the putative niclosamide hit, which can be helpful to provide more confidence in the binding mode hypothesis and customise/extend the scope of the associated designs.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION: A Nitrile group, placed at ortho-position to the sulfonamide moiety of fragment x0161, is able to fit a sub pocket located where water molecule W116 (Structure x0336) is located. This substitution can impact favourably ligand binding both from an enthalpic and entropic contributions (i.e. Biophys J. 2015 Feb 17; 108(4): 928–936). 

Alternatively the Nitrile group can be replaced by a cyclic N-acyl sulfoximine core. It is able to fit a sub pocket located where W116 (Structure x0336) is located. The carbonyl oxygen at the cyclic N-acyl sulfoximine core is able to interact (H bond) with the Gln192 side chain and Thr190 backbone. This group is located in an overlapping region to the occupied volume by the sulfoxide oxigen of DMS901 (structure x0354). The S-attached methyl group of the chiral core (R enantiomer) is interacting with Pro168, while the S-attached oxygen atom is (favourably) directed towards a more solvent exposed area of the binding pocket. 

At the para-position (to the S-attached sulfoximine substituent) of the aromatic ring, the binding pocket is more shallow and able to accommodate several different structural motifs. Bulky, sp3 rich motifs should be well tolerated in this region and could enable the ideation of structurally diverse lead molecules with good solubility and PK properties. 

A set 7 and 8 membered rings structures derived from the Crystallography Open Database (stripped of major substituents) were rigidly docked to assess the potential fit to this accessory binding pocket. This approach was used in order to avoid incurring MM minimization artifacts and to quickly get a flavour of interesting substituents worth exploring. The 1,4-oxazepine derivative is inspired from the Crystallography Open Database (ref. 1100289) after QM optimization. The N-attached methyl group is fitting into the hydrophobic pocket delimited by Met165 and Phe181 side chains. Similarly, a polar lipophilic pocket compatible unit, such as a nitrile (R-CN, where R is an aromatic group) has also been seen to explore such a region (fragment  x0305). The methyl group attached to the carbon at the 3 position of the oxazepinone is interacting with the Met165 side chain. The oxygen (position 1 of the oxazepinone) is almost coplanar to the aromatic ring, towards the solvent exposed area of the binding pocket.  The carbonyl oxygen is placed in a mild polar binding pocket, interacting with a conserved water molecule (W6). Some of the reported oxazepinones might be challenging to synthesize or introduce unwanted complexity in the designed compound (i.e. 3 chiral centers).
 
Alternatively, a sulfonamide to a non cyclic acyl sulfoximine transformation was applied. The S-attached methyl group of the chiral group (S enantiomer) is interacting with Pro168, while the S-attached oxygen atom is directed towards a more solvent exposed area. The carbonyl oxygen of the acyl group is interacting with W39 and the amide NH is hydrogen bonded with Glu166 backbone. Pyridine nitrogen is interacting with water molecules W116.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION: Fluorination (at the 3 position of the tetrahydroquinoline core) to increase ligand volume occupancy with no disruption of the water network surrounding the binding pocket (MD simulation analysis). Methylation at the 4 position of the tetrahydroquinoline core. The methyl group will adopt an equatorial preferred orientation (i.e. Crystallography Open Database ref. 2213899) impacting favourably ligand binding both from an enthalpic and entropic contributions (i.e. Biophys J. 2015 Feb 17; 108(4): 928–936). Similarly, a polar lipophilic pocket compatible unit, such as a nitrile (R-CN, where R is an aromatic group) has also been seen to occupy that subpocket (fragment x0305). No step-change in activities between the two enantiomers has been predicted. A single methyl group substituent will tend to adopt an axial preferred orientation.  Gem-dimethyl group at the 4 position of the tetrahydroquinoline core is tolerated. Fluorination at the 5 position is placed in a mildly polar region of the binding pocket (small but significant enthalpic contribution). The alkyl portion of the tetrahydropyranyl moiety (position 1 of the tetrahydroquinoline) is able to interact with the Met49 side chain (hydrophobic interaction) while exposing the polar cyclic ether moiety towards the solvent exposed region. In particular the tetrahydropyran oxygen is interacting with the Ser46 side chain (favorable polar interaction). Such an interaction is quite solvent exposed therefore providing a negligible impact (enthalpic contribution) to the ligand binding energy. The tetrahydropyran oxygen is located in an overlapping region to the carbonyl oxygen of the N-acyl piperazine moiety (structure ref. x0354).

In order to reduce a potential CYP induction liability a sulfonamide to the sulfoximine transformation was applied (Org. Chem. Front., 2019,6, 1319-1324). The S-attached methyl group of the chiral group (S enantiomer) is interacting with Pro168, while the S-attached oxygen atom is directed towards a more solvent exposed area. The sulfoximine NH is interacting with the Glu166 backbone (Hydrogen bond) and thus having a similar protein-ligand interaction pattern of the parent fragment. Pyridine nitrogen can interact with water molecule W116.","x0195,x0305",False,False,False,https://covid.postera.ai/covid/submissions/fa25ac7f-b7ca-4ac6-8a32-5070858535ad,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False

BRIEF DESCRIPTION: Fluorination (at the 3 position of the tetrahydroquinoline core) to increase ligand volume occupancy with no disruption of the water network surrounding the binding pocket (MD simulation analysis). Methylation at the 4 position of the tetrahydroquinoline core. The methyl group will adopt an equatorial preferred orientation (i.e. Crystallography Open Database ref. 2213899) impacting favourably ligand binding both from an enthalpic and entropic contributions (i.e. Biophys J. 2015 Feb 17; 108(4): 928–936). Similarly, a polar lipophilic pocket compatible unit, such as a nitrile (R-CN, where R is an aromatic group) has also been seen to occupy that subpocket (fragment x0305). No step-change in activities between the two enantiomers has been predicted. A single methyl group substituent will tend to adopt an axial preferred orientation.  Gem-dimethyl group at the 4 position of the tetrahydroquinoline core is tolerated. Fluorination at the 5 position is placed in a mildly polar region of the binding pocket (small but significant enthalpic contribution). The alkyl portion of the tetrahydropyranyl moiety (position 1 of the tetrahydroquinoline) is able to interact with the Met49 side chain (hydrophobic interaction) while exposing the polar cyclic ether moiety towards the solvent exposed region. In particular the tetrahydropyran oxygen is interacting with the Ser46 side chain (favorable polar interaction). Such an interaction is quite solvent exposed therefore providing a negligible impact (enthalpic contribution) to the ligand binding energy. The tetrahydropyran oxygen is located in an overlapping region to the carbonyl oxygen of the N-acyl piperazine moiety (structure ref. x0354).

In order to reduce a potential CYP induction liability a sulfonamide to the sulfoximine transformation was applied (Org. Chem. Front., 2019,6, 1319-1324). The S-attached methyl group of the chiral group (S enantiomer) is interacting with Pro168, while the S-attached oxygen atom is directed towards a more solvent exposed area. The sulfoximine NH is interacting with the Glu166 backbone (Hydrogen bond) and thus having a similar protein-ligand interaction pattern of the parent fragment. Pyridine nitrogen can interact with water molecule W116.","x0195,x0305",False,False,False,https://covid.postera.ai/covid/submissions/fa25ac7f-b7ca-4ac6-8a32-5070858535ad,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False

With this aim, we took from e-Drug3D (https://chemoinfo.ipmc.cnrs.fr/MOLDB/index.php) all the 1930 molecular structures approved between 1939 and 2019 by the FDA with a molecular weight ≤ 2000 Da and docked them at the binding site of 6LU7 structure by using three different docking programs (i.e., GlideSP, FRED and VINA). For each ligand and docking program, we have kept the top 10 docked poses (i.e., 10 for GlideSP, 10 for FRED and 10 for VINA). When considering 10 poses per ligand/program we assume that one of them will be the bioactive one (although the score function not always have ranked it as the first one). Finally the bioactive pose is assumed to be identified if it has been found simultaneously by the three programs (this means that the rmsd for each pairwise pose comparison is below 1.5 angstroms). Our idea here is that, in general, protein-ligand docking programs are really good when trying to look for the possible poses of a ligand in a binding site but usually fail to rank correctly such poses. Then, if three different protein-ligand programs find the same pose, this have a high probability to be the bioactive one.

Then, we applied a second filter in order to keep only those poses that are not only identified by the three programs but also show high affinity for M-pro. In order to find which threshold can be used to discriminate high from low affinity poses, we docked the 1577 compounds from the OTAVA Machine Learning SARS Targeted Library (https://otavachemicals.com/targets/sars-cov-2-targeted-libraries?utm_medium=email&utm_source=UniSender&utm_campaign=229613803) into the binding site of 6LU7 with GlideSP, FRED and VINA (with the identical set up conditions than were previously used for the 1930 FDA approved compounds). For this docking, we kept only the top-ranked pose obtained for each ligand by each programs. Then, we make three different histograms for the docking results of the OTAVA library (one per program) and arbitrarily selected as a threshold for distinguish from low to high M-pro affinity the lowest score value of the interval that contains the top 30% poses with the highest affinity. The resulting threshold was -6.3 for GlideSP, -7.0 for FRED and -7.5 for VINA. Then, all the poses that had succeed the first filter but had scores more positive than these threshold values were removed.

Then, only 5 FDA approved compounds simultaneously accomplished that: (1) the same pose is found independently by GlideSP, FRED and VINA; and (2) this pose has score values equal or more negative than the three mentioned thresholds.

With this aim, we took from e-Drug3D (https://chemoinfo.ipmc.cnrs.fr/MOLDB/index.php) all the 1930 molecular structures approved between 1939 and 2019 by the FDA with a molecular weight ≤ 2000 Da and docked them at the binding site of 6LU7 structure by using three different docking programs (i.e., GlideSP, FRED and VINA). For each ligand and docking program, we have kept the top 10 docked poses (i.e., 10 for GlideSP, 10 for FRED and 10 for VINA). When considering 10 poses per ligand/program we assume that one of them will be the bioactive one (although the score function not always have ranked it as the first one). Finally the bioactive pose is assumed to be identified if it has been found simultaneously by the three programs (this means that the rmsd for each pairwise pose comparison is below 1.5 angstroms). Our idea here is that, in general, protein-ligand docking programs are really good when trying to look for the possible poses of a ligand in a binding site but usually fail to rank correctly such poses. Then, if three different protein-ligand programs find the same pose, this have a high probability to be the bioactive one.

Then, we applied a second filter in order to keep only those poses that are not only identified by the three programs but also show high affinity for M-pro. In order to find which threshold can be used to discriminate high from low affinity poses, we docked the 1577 compounds from the OTAVA Machine Learning SARS Targeted Library (https://otavachemicals.com/targets/sars-cov-2-targeted-libraries?utm_medium=email&utm_source=UniSender&utm_campaign=229613803) into the binding site of 6LU7 with GlideSP, FRED and VINA (with the identical set up conditions than were previously used for the 1930 FDA approved compounds). For this docking, we kept only the top-ranked pose obtained for each ligand by each programs. Then, we make three different histograms for the docking results of the OTAVA library (one per program) and arbitrarily selected as a threshold for distinguish from low to high M-pro affinity the lowest score value of the interval that contains the top 30% poses with the highest affinity. The resulting threshold was -6.3 for GlideSP, -7.0 for FRED and -7.5 for VINA. Then, all the poses that had succeed the first filter but had scores more positive than these threshold values were removed.

Then, only 5 FDA approved compounds simultaneously accomplished that: (1) the same pose is found independently by GlideSP, FRED and VINA; and (2) this pose has score values equal or more negative than the three mentioned thresholds.

No additional human or algorithmic filtering has been done. (Note the double sulphone warhead in one of the molecules!)

I chose this method due to bitter experience in molecular design with both computational and machine learning approaches. Due to the exponentially large chemical configuration space, any attempt to optimise a metric with errors (such as docking) will lead to the selection of the much more numerous false-positives than a genuine hit. By constraining the design algorithm to mixing two known-valid molecules (the fragments from Diamond), you strongly bias the exploration of chemical space to plausible regions, while giving sufficient freedom for the algorithm to select arbitrary combinations that would not be considered by a human.  

As the structures are two fused fragments, they are approaching the size of a drug-like molecule. 

All of these structures docked (Vina) at -9.0 -- -9.7 kcal/mol .

It occurred to me that the sizes of the HIT molecules and the placement of the functional groups were similar to commercial CNS antidepressants. My question was ""could such drugs work as antiviral agents?"" If so, use could be very quick. 

Taking Imipramine and converting the end group to an amide produced a molecule that, under superposition with HITs, produced a close match with their functional groups. The trans-gauche side-chain structure is the most stable conformer in solution. Hence I thought it was worth submitting at this early stage of participation.

Further modification could be removing one of the aromatic rings. I have submitted a .pdb file but not as a ""bound"" structure. I do not have this capability at the moment but will do soon.

This generative model was sampled, and produced ~20,000 novel structures. The QED score for each generated molecule was computed, and the top 1,000 generated molecules according to QED score were kept. Any generated molecules that were identical to the submissions were discarded during generation. Also, the Tanimoto similarity of each generated molecule was computed against each submission and fragment molecule, and any generated molecule with a Tanimoto similarity >= 0.9 was discarded during generation. The generated compounds generally had low average Tanimoto similarity to the submission and fragment compounds. This set of 1,000 generated molecules was combined with a set of 1,018 molecules generated on a previous date (using a different language model).

Each of the 2,018 generated molecules were then submitted to docking with the SARS-CoV-2 apo-MPro protein structure from the 6YB7_model.pdb file (provided by Diamond Light Source), using AutoDock Vina, with an exhaustiveness value of 16. Docking was focused on the active site. The molecules with a best mode binding energy of -7.9 kcal/mol or less were kept, resulting in 30 candidates. These 30 molecules were then docked once again, but using an exhaustiveness value of 256. Docking was repeated 3 times for each of the candidates. Also, the Synthetic Accessibility (SA) score was calculated for each candidate, as well as a toxicity estimate using the ProTox-II web service.

This set of 1,000 generated molecules was combined with a set of 1,018 molecules generated on a previous date (using a different language model).

Each of the 2,018 generated molecules were then submitted to docking with the SARS-CoV-2 apo-MPro protein structure from the 6YB7_model.pdb file (provided by Diamond Light Source), using AutoDock Vina, with an exhaustiveness value of 16. Docking was focused on the active site. The molecules with a best mode binding energy of -7.9 kcal/mol or less were kept, resulting in 30 candidates.

The compound was highly stable and makes several consistent interactions with the binding site residues throughout the simulation, such as:
1. The pyridine N makes a very strong hydrogen bond with nearby His163 sidechain.
2. The same pyridine creates an aromatic interaction environment with nearby aromatic residues, His163 and His172.
3. The terminal amino group on pyridine ring, on the virtue of being protonated at physiological pH, makes a salt-bridge interaction with negatively-charged Glu166.
4. The same terminal amino group on pyridine ring, also makes a hydrogen bond with side-chain amide group of Asn142. 
5. One of the carbonyl oxygens on the middle dipyrimidone-like ring makes the pivotal hydrogen bond interaction with backbone of His164. 
6. The other carbonyl oxygen on the dipyrimidone-like ring could make a very likely interaction with backbone of Gly149, as this is present on a very long and flexible loop. The primary reason of making the dipyrimidone was to constrain the orientation of the molecule and connect different pieces of molecule.
7. The fused phenyl group of dipyrimidone-like entity provides critical aromatic interaction with aromatic residue His41.
8. The imidazole also makes a highly favorable aromatic interaction with side-chain of His41, along with a hydrogen bond between imidazole NH and N of His41.

3) shortlisted  4YoJ, inhibitor is with 0.4 uM one of the most potent inhibitors for related enzymes, synthesis appears to be pretty straight forward (Targeting zoonotic viruses: Structure-based inhibition of the 3C-like protease from bat coronavirus HKU4—The likely reservoir host to the human coronavirus that causes Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), Sarah E.St. JohnabcSakshiTomaracShaun R.StaufferdeAndrew D.Mesecarabc )
4) The core (amid bond) of the ligand in 4YOJ also superimposes very well with  X_0434 and X_0678
5) P1 is occupied by benzotriazol in 4YOJ, should also fit in Mpro
6) pyridine (found in X_0107, X_0434, X_0678) should also fit in this pocket
7) X_0995 has a pyrimidine, but this can not easily be attached to the core
8) other heterocycles which have an acceptor group overlapping with the nitrogen atom in X_0107 could also be explored
9) P2-P4 pocket is occupied with a thiophenyl group in 4YOJ
10) this area is not well explored by the fragments. The fragments that bind there don't have a vector that could be joined with the core of the ligand in 4YOJ
10) based on synthetic route described in the paper mentioned above, Enamine building block library was searched for in stock compounds which have an aldehyde group directly attached to an aromatic ring => 429 this
11) Used RDkit to replace the part of the ligand in 4YOJ that goes into this subpocket and docked the resulting compounds into the X_0107 binding site using FlexX, used parts of ligand in 4YOJ as template, rescoring was done with Hyde
12) This pocket is very tight and only three reasonable hits very obtained (predicted affinity low micromolar, N-methyl-pyrol, Fluro-thiophen, Fluro-furan)
13) other five-membered rings could also be explored
14) P2-P1' pocket is rather hydrophobic, X_1334, X_1412, X_1385, X_1380, X_1336, X_0774, but the vectors in these fragments are not suited to link them with the core of the ligand in 4YOJ
15) searched Enamine building blocks library for aromatic and aliphatic amines which are in stock => 549 hits
16) Used RDkit to replace the part of the ligand in 4YOJ that goes into this subpocket and docked the resulting compounds  into the X_0107 binding site using FlexX, used parts of ligand in 4YOJ as template, rescoring was done with Hyde
17) as expected, many hydrophobic substituents scored well, some hits were selected based on visual exception

Based on these results, I suggest to
1) synthesize and test the ligand that is contained in 4YOJ
2) replace each of the substituents in this ligand  addressing the different subpockets (3 for P1 based on the fragment hits, 4 for P2-P4 and 11 for P2-P1'). Depending on the synthetic and testing capacities, either only one of the substituents can be exchanged at the time, resulting in 18 different ligands or combinations can be explored, resulting in max 240 ligands (if the substituents of the ligand in 4YOJ are also considered).","x0434,x0678",False,False,False,https://covid.postera.ai/covid/submissions/630c5802-c798-4851-bad3-ec1fea6b34fb,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False

To enable this, we used Cyclica’s Ligand Design™  (LD), a flexible machine learning for identifying molecules that best satisfy a defined objective function. Briefly, LD traverses a chemical space iteratively by repeatedly deriving new molecules (children) from previous selections (parents) and then filtering them with respect to one or more objective functions. This optimization process proceeds until convergence, when no better molecules can be found. Ligand Design has multiple options for traversing chemical space, including fixed library screening (10^6 molecules evaluated), rule-based semi-generative approaches (~10^10 molecules represented), and fully generative options (~10^120 molecule possibilities). Importantly, for this design challenge, we used the semi-generative option for LD (that was developed with support from our Partners at Enamine), which efficiently traverses the Enamine REAL Space of molecules to identify promising molecules with high synthetic accessibility. 

For this design challenge, we applied two major selective pressures (objective functions). The first optimizes for compatibility with the 3CLpro binding site using Cyclica’s MatchMaker Deep Learning proteome-screening engine (white paper here: https://tinyurl.com/wx3yg64). MatchMaker has been found to be far more accurate than molecular docking, and is also several orders of magnitude more computationally efficient. The second is a ligand-based model consisting of all active fragments coming from the XChem screen. This model was created using our POEM technology (https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.04555), a parameter-free supervised learning algorithm that utilizes multiple fingerprints simultaneously for improved predictive performance. Incorporation of this POEM model pressures LD to evolve molecules which resemble the fragment set (and prioritizes the molecules with higher occupancy in the crystal structures). Additional filters ensure that all molecules evaluated have ‘drug-like’ physicochemical properties and exclude problematic functional groups.  

Cyclica’s Ligand Design was applied using default parameters, allowing the optimization to proceed until convergence. The resulting process automatically defined a total of 106 ‘top molecules’ on the basis of proteome screening ranks. Among these top molecules, 35 ranked the corona virus protease compatibility higher than any human protein (~8000 present in the screen). A semi-manual curation process was applied to the 106 to prioritize molecules for submission. The first three were selected on the basis of having substructures with exact matches to hits from the XChem fragment screen. Next, we clustered the remaining top molecules using a multiple fingerprint approach and selected the 10 cluster exemplars for a total of 13 submissions. Any positive hits among cluster exemplars would merit subsequent investigation of the remaining cluster members.  

Note, For this submission Cyclica’s Ligand Design was used in its default state with no algorithmic customization or further optimizations to strictly enforce the presence of select fragments. We are open to further customizing this LD design process in subsequent design iterations, in order to incorporate the the expert insights of medicinal chemists involved in this project.","x0072,x0161,x0995",False,False,False,https://covid.postera.ai/covid/submissions/1a381570-5caa-4095-b2ba-625dc8939023,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False

To enable this, we used Cyclica’s Ligand Design™  (LD), a flexible machine learning for identifying molecules that best satisfy a defined objective function. Briefly, LD traverses a chemical space iteratively by repeatedly deriving new molecules (children) from previous selections (parents) and then filtering them with respect to one or more objective functions. This optimization process proceeds until convergence, when no better molecules can be found. Ligand Design has multiple options for traversing chemical space, including fixed library screening (10^6 molecules evaluated), rule-based semi-generative approaches (~10^10 molecules represented), and fully generative options (~10^120 molecule possibilities). Importantly, for this design challenge, we used the semi-generative option for LD (that was developed with support from our Partners at Enamine), which efficiently traverses the Enamine REAL Space of molecules to identify promising molecules with high synthetic accessibility. 

For this design challenge, we applied two major selective pressures (objective functions). The first optimizes for compatibility with the 3CLpro binding site using Cyclica’s MatchMaker Deep Learning proteome-screening engine (white paper here: https://tinyurl.com/wx3yg64). MatchMaker has been found to be far more accurate than molecular docking, and is also several orders of magnitude more computationally efficient. The second is a ligand-based model consisting of all active fragments coming from the XChem screen. This model was created using our POEM technology (https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.04555), a parameter-free supervised learning algorithm that utilizes multiple fingerprints simultaneously for improved predictive performance. Incorporation of this POEM model pressures LD to evolve molecules which resemble the fragment set (and prioritizes the molecules with higher occupancy in the crystal structures). Additional filters ensure that all molecules evaluated have ‘drug-like’ physicochemical properties and exclude problematic functional groups.  

Cyclica’s Ligand Design was applied using default parameters, allowing the optimization to proceed until convergence.

NS(=O)(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)NC[C@@H]1CCCO1,WIL-NOV-066-1,"Wilian Cortopassi, Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research (NIBR)","Rationale: The binding site of MPro_x1086 and MPro_x1187 connects two highly flexible termini regions of MPro. In other coronaviruses, e.g. SARS-CoV, these termini regions were shown to play an important role in protease activity and dimerization.(1,2) This idea here presented consists in merging these two fragments to explore distinct networks of hydrogen bonds and a pi-pi stacking with Phe8. A minimized complex with this new proposed ligand in MPro is available (attached). It shows hydrogen bonds with the backbone of Met6, T-shaped pi-pi interactions with Phe8 and a cation-pi interaction between the phenyl ring of the molecule and Arg298. This would provide a lead compound for Mpro inhibition, with significant room for ligand optimization.
Methodology: An initial visual inspection identified the pocket of MPro_x1086 and MPro_x1187 among the very few outside of the protease activity pocket of MPro that is not fully solvent exposed, and therefore it provides room for ligand optimization. MPro_x1086 forms a unique hydrogen bond with the backbone of Met6, and its phenyl group forms a pi-pi interaction with Phe8. Furthermore, its –NH2 group is close enough to the side chain of Asp295, raising the possibility of additional H-bonds. MPro_x1187 also forms pi-pi stacking with Phe8, while its amide group is not very far from Asn299. Therefore, a hybrid molecule consisting of these two fragments was built, and further minimized in MPro.

We then identified a reactive cysteine (Cys300) in a nearby pocket by using the ICM (MolSoft LLC) cysteine reactivity predictor. This proposal consists on designing compounds that mimic interactions of fragments x1086 and x1187 and are able to form a covalent bond with Cys300.
Methodology: The previously identified non-covalent binder of Mpro was modified by introducing a reactive nitrile group in its side chain. Then, this compound was docked to Mpro using the CovDock tool in Schrodinger, and selecting Cys300 as the reactive residue. Although most docking poses had an exposed sulfonamide group, we identified a conformation that was able to mimic interactions observed in the crystal structure of Mpro bound to x1086, i.e. a p-p interaction with Phe8 and hydrogen bond interactions with the backbone of Met6. The non-aromatic 5-membered ring of our previously designed compound was not making favorable interactions with its surrounding residues, and therefore it was removed. Addition of a morpholine group was done aiming at occupying a similar site as observed in the crystal structure of x1187. A further addition of a cyclopropane (or methyl groups) was aimed at improving PK properties, as previously observed for other cysteine protease inhibitors(1).
